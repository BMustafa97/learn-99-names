# Arabic Recognition App

This is a web application that combines Arabic speech recognition with the [`quranic-universal-library`](https://github.com/TarteelAI/quranic-universal-library) GitHub library to provide access to Quranic text and metadata. The app allows users to speak in Arabic and have their speech recognized and processed.

### Integrating with Quranic Universal Library

The current frontend implementation includes placeholders for Quranic text search. To fully integrate with the `quranic-universal-library`, you'll need to:

1. **Create a Backend API**: Set up a Node.js server that uses the `quranic-universal-library`
2. **API Endpoints**: Create endpoints to search and retrieve Quranic text
3. **Frontend Integration**: Connect the speech recognition results to your backend API

Example backend integration:

```js
// backend/server.js
const express = require('express');
const { Quran } = require('quranic-universal-library');
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());
app.use(cors()); // Enable CORS for frontend

app.post('/api/search', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { searchText } = req.body;
    const quran = new Quran();
    
    // Search for the text in Quranic verses
    const results = await quran.search(searchText);
    res.json(results);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
  }
});

app.listen(3001, () => {
  console.log('Backend server running on port 3001');
});
```

### Current Implementation

The current web application includes:
- ‚úÖ Arabic speech recognition using Web Speech API
- ‚úÖ Real-time transcription display
- ‚úÖ Clean, responsive user interface
- ‚è≥ Quranic search integration (requires backend setup)
